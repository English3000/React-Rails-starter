## [React-Rails](https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails#react-rails) Starter

### Updates

Refactored `Header` (now `AuthHeader`) & `Nav` into `Pages`!

### Features

- [x] basic setup

- [x] user auth

- [x] server-side rendering (along with client-side)

- [x] custom components for React Native integration

- [ ] `webpack-dev-server` config _(if you get it bug-free before I do, submit yours as an issue)_

**React Native starter coming soon!**

### Upon cloning,

* `bundle install`
* `rails db:setup`

If you haven't already, check out [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/version3.html). When you do `rails s` & `webpack --watch`, you can have each in a horizontally-split frame and a third for command line navigation.

Also, Expo's [XDE](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/installation.html) is great for development/testing.
